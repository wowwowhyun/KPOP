<h2>What is KPOP ?</h2>
K-pop (Korean: 케이팝; RR: keipap), short for <strong>Korean popular music</strong>, is a genre of music originating in South Korea as part of South Korean culture.[1] It is influenced by styles and genres from around the world, such as pop, experimental, rock, jazz, gospel, hip hop, R&B, reggae, electronic dance, folk, country, and classical on top of its traditional Korean music roots.[2] The more modern form of the genre emerged with the formation of one of the earliest K-pop groups, the boy band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seo_Taiji_and_Boys" target="_blank">Seo Taiji and Boys</a>, in 1992. Their experimentation with different styles and genres of music and integration of foreign musical elements helped reshape and modernize South Korea's contemporary music scene.[3]<br><br><br>
Modern K-pop "idol" culture began in the 1990s, as K-pop grew into a subculture that amassed enormous fandoms of teenagers and young adults.[4][5] After a slump in early K-pop, from 2003 TVXQ and BoA started a new generation of K-pop idols that broke the music genre into the neighboring Japanese market and continue to popularize K-pop internationally today.[6][7] With the advent of online social networking services and South Korean TV shows, the current spread of K-pop and South Korean entertainment, known as the Korean Wave, is seen not only in East Asia and Southeast Asia, but also in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Latin America, North Africa, Southern Africa and East Africa, the Middle East and throughout the Western world, gaining an international audience.
